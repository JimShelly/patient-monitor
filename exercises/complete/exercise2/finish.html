        <p>
          A pangram (Greek: παν γράμμα, pan gramma, "every letter") or
          holoalphabetic sentence is a sentence using every letter of a given
          alphabet at least once. Pangrams have been used to display typefaces,
          test equipment, and develop skills in handwriting, calligraphy, and
          keyboarding. The best-known English pangram is "The quick brown fox
          jumps over the lazy dog". It has been used since at least the late
          19th century, was utilized by Western Union to test Telex / TWX data
          communication equipment for accuracy and reliability,[1] and is now
          used by a number of computer programs (most notably the font viewer
          built into Microsoft Windows) to display computer fonts.

          Write a JavaScript program that determines if what you type in the
          text box is a pangram.
